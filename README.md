# SLAO: Node.js + Express monitoring

**SLAO collects metrics, monitors the performance and correctness of your REST API from a single, simple dashboard.**

[https://slao.io](https://slao.io)

SLAO helps developers and support engineers answer next questions in real time:

- ðŸ“ˆ How many requests does my REST API serve
- ðŸš© What response codes my REST API's clients receive
- âš¡ How fast does my REST API respond to my clients' requests

Unlike other overloaded APMs, SLAO is about the essentials: requestsâ€™ rate and duration, status codes and custom tags.

We do not collect any sensitive data like query parametes, request or response body, headers or cookies, SLAO agent is open-source.

# SLAO: Node.js + Express monitoring

**SLAO collects metrics, monitors the performance and correctness of your REST API from a single, simple dashboard.**

[https://slao.io](https://slao.io)

SLAO helps developers and support engineers answer next questions:

- ðŸ“ˆ How many requests does my REST API serve
- ðŸš© What response codes my REST API's clients receive
- âš¡ How fast does my REST API respond to my clients' requests

SLAO is about the essentials: requests rate and duration, status codes and custom tags, it's not another overloaded APM.

We do not collect any sensitive data like qury parametes, request or response body, headers or cookies, SLAO agent is open-source.

#### [📊 SLAO](https://slao.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=github&utm_content=link): Alerts and Monitoring for Node.js Microservices

[https://slao.io](https://slao.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=github&utm_content=link)

### A single place for monitoring all your Node.js microservices

- 📈 __Spot the key metrics of each microservice:__ _Requests count, request duration, status codes, unfinished requests are simple but valuable metrics that SLAO tracks for you_

- 👌 __Be confident that everything is working fine:__ _Define assertions in 2 clicks and stay updated about your microservices' health via email, Telegram, Slack or a custom webhook_

- 🛡️ __Your privacy first:__ _We collect only the minimal set of necessary data, we do not collect any private information. SLAO agent is open-source_

- ⚙️ __Beyond the basics:__ _Expand your dashboard by adding custom tags to your requests. Mark requests that were cached, divide them by the type of response or user id_

- 💰 __Fair pricing:__ _The price depends only on the number of days we keep your data on our servers. You don't have to pay for every microservice and host_
